# Chakrulo
It’s often been said that Georgian folk singing is out of the world. That’s quite literally the case with one particular song, “Chakrulo.” Forty years ago, it went into space on board the Voyager spacecraft as part of NASA’s message to the universe. With its eye on fame in this galaxy and beyond, Georgia has not missed the chance to mark the anniversary.
